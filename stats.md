## Stats
* Mean, Median, Mode
* Range
* Standard deviation, Variance
* Skewness
* Central Limit Theorem
* Percentiles or Quartiles
* Pearson r
* Z-score, p-value
* Student t-test, p-value  (2 groups)
* KS test
* Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) (2+ groups)

_P-Value_
*Definitions*:  P-value - calculation that indicates the total likelihood of the value falling to the right of the selected value.  
*Visual meaning*: Considering the population distribution, with a known mean and standard deviation, the sample mean's position on the population distribution makes a smaller area than the area of the alpha value and indicates that the sample is from another distribution or is not a random sample from the population.
*Assumptions*: Data is normally distributed; a alpha value has been selected based on industry accepted values or for the scenario of the situation.
*Reminders*:  alpha value affects the curve where a lower alpha generates a taller and more narrow distribution with smaller tails.
*Tests*:  Used with Z-score or t-test
