### Commond Distributions used in Data Science

1. Normal (Gaussian) Distribution: One of the most widely used distributions in data science. It is characterized by its bell-shaped curve and is often used to model continuous data that is symmetrically distributed around the mean.

2. Binomial Distribution: Used for modeling the number of successes in a fixed number of independent Bernoulli trials (experiments with two possible outcomes, usually success or failure).

3. Poisson Distribution: Suitable for modeling the number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space, assuming the events occur at a constant rate and independently of the time since the last event.

4. Exponential Distribution: Frequently used for modeling the time between events in a Poisson process (events occurring at a constant rate and independently).

5. Uniform Distribution: Used when all values in a given range are equally likely to occur. It is often used for generating random numbers.

6. Log-Normal Distribution: Often applied to data that is positively skewed, and its logarithm follows a normal distribution.

7. Beta Distribution: Used to model data with values that are constrained to lie between 0 and 1, such as proportions or probabilities.

8. Gamma Distribution: Suitable for modeling waiting times or survival times and is often used in reliability engineering and survival analysis.

9. Chi-Squared Distribution: Frequently used in hypothesis testing and confidence interval estimation, particularly in the context of the chi-squared test.

10. F-Distribution: Used in statistical inference, particularly in analysis of variance (ANOVA) and regression analysis.
